Bio
=====
I'm a West Virginia native, born and raised in Morgantown. I completed my undergrad years at West Virginia University in 2019, graduating with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and minors in Math and Physics. In my free time during undergrad I participated in student org leadership, namely the WVU Amateur Radio Club (which was my pride and joy). I found great reward in building a very old club (established circa 1912) which had somewhat fallen into decay into one of the premier student orgs at WVU. This was capped off nicely when ARC was named the 2018-2019 WVU Outstanding Organization. 

In addition to serving organizations at WVU, I was honored to be the IEEE Region 2 Student Representative for two years. IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization, serving 400,000 members globally, 1/4 of which are student or graduate student members. IEEE is divided into ten regions worldwide. In this role, I was responsible for planning and executing two regional student conferences as well as various smaller events. 

During my junior summer I was selected as an Undergraduate Research Fellow at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder Colorado. While there, when I wasn't hiking or traveling, I performed user equipment conformance testing for mission critical services under 3GPP Release 14&15, as well as authoring parts of the MCS Work Plan for those releases. 

I'm currently studying for my PhD and working as a graduate research assistant for Wireless@VT, where I'm advised by Prof. Buehrer. To see what I'm working on check the tabs up top.
